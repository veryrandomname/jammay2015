The Heroine awoke.
It was so darn dark in the Room, in which she awoke, she could barely see her own hands. 
Her back was wet from the soaked Hay she arose from.
She ignited a Spark to light up the Room, centering itself in the middle of the temporary imprisonment.
In the darkest Corner, she found the Outline of what could be a Chest.
On the opposite side of the Room, a Door symbolized in runic Letters.]],

She moved towards the Chest.
With the small Amount of Strength she had left, she tried to open the Chest.
She threw her whole Weight against the Lock and luckily the Chest Lid flew open, only to back-swing and injure the Heroine.
Blood dribbled down her Ribs. //Bleeding
Panting.
The Odds where with her, as she found Cloth Rags, a Sack and a Robe.]],

The Heroine walks to the Door, while trying to decipher the Runic Symbols.
As she touched the Letters, her Spark faded in the blink of a second.
It was dark again.
But then a sudden reddish glow emerged from the ensign, a crackle to be heard.
Flames burst forth, enlightening the housing.
In panic she stumbled backward.
The Door manifested and swung open, whilst the Flames started to devour the Building.
Realizing the new hazard was about to consume her life, she made a run, startled by her fear.
Emerging from the Ruins of her former Imprisonment, the Heroine, weak and broken, took a look at the new Environment, while enjoying her freedom with a sigh of release.]],
