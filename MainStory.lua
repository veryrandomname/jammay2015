Katheryn Alyayna awoke.
It was so darn dark in the Room, in which she awoke, she could barely see her own hands. 
Her back was wet from the soaked Hay she arose from.
She ignited a Spark to light up the Room, centering itself in the middle of the temporary imprisonment.
In the darkest Corner, she found the Outline of what could be a Chest.
On the opposite side of the Room, a Door symbolized in runic Letters.]],

She moved towards the Chest.
With the small Amount of Strength she had left, she tried to open the Chest.
She threw her whole Weight against the Lock and luckily the Chest Lid flew open, only to back-swing and injured Katheryn.
Blood dribbled down her Ribs. --Bleeding
Panting.
The Odds where with her, as she found Cloth Rags, a Sack and a Robe.]],

Katheryn walked to the Door, while trying to decipher the Runic Symbols.
As she touched the Letters, her Spark faded in the blink of a second.
It was dark again.
But then a sudden reddish glow emerged from the ensign, a crackle to be heard.
Flames burst forth, enlightening the housing.
In panic she stumbled backward.
The Door manifested and swung open, whilst the Flames started to devour the Building.
Realizing the new hazard was about to consume her life, she made a run, startled by her fear.
Emerging from the Ruins of her former Imprisonment, Katheryn, weak and broken, took a look at the new Environment, while enjoying her freedom with a sigh of release.]],

The Lake, clear, smooth and of a Color dark as the Night surrounding her, lay still.
Awaiting.
She could see the mirror image of the house burning apart, while feeling the heat in her neck.
The Moon, full and bright climbed the sky-plane, putting the Scene in a gloomy Shade.
She turned around to see Trees. Lots of Trees.
Lost in a Forrest at Night with the only possible Shelter burning down to a skeleton.
But there it was, a pathway leading through the Forrest.
