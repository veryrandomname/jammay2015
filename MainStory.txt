The Heroine awoke.
It was so darn dark in the Room, in which she awoke, she could barely see her own hands.
Her back was wet from the soaked Hay she arose from.
She ignited a Spark to light up the Room.
In the darkest Corner, she found the Outline of what could be a Chest.
On the opposite side of the Room, a Door symbolized in runic Letters.

// Interact: Chest
She moved towards the Chest.
With the small Amount of Strength she had left, she tried to open the Chest.
She threw her whole Weight against the Lock and luckily the Chest Lid flew open, only to back-swing and injure the Heroine.
Blood dribbled down her Ribs. //Bleeding
Panting.
The Odds where with her, as she found Cloth Rags, a Sack and a Robe.
